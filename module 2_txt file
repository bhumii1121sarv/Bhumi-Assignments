QUESTION 1 : How memory is managed in Python?
ANSWER : The Python memory manager is involved only in the allocation of the bytes object returned as a result.
In most situations, however, it is recommended to allocate memory from the Python heap specifically because the latter is under control of the Python memory manager.
a = 1234
print(id(a))

QUESTION 2 :What is the purpose continue statement in python
ANSWER : the continue statement we can stop the current iteration, and continue with the next
 EX:
 i = 1
 while i < 6 :
     i += 1:
    if i == 3 :
       continue 
    print(i)
    
QUESTION 3 : What are negative indexes and why are they used ?
ANSWER : Negative Indexing is used to in Python to begin slicing from the end of the string i.e. the last. Slicing in Python gets a sub-string from a string. The slicing range is set as parameters i.e. start, stop and step.
A = "1,2,3,4,5,6"
V = A.index(-1,-3)
print(V)
